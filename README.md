# **Background**
This project was done to practice using React.js and APIs. The languages used are Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The IDE I used Was VSCode.

# **Functionality**
This weather app fetches weather data from the free API openweathermap.org. It then displays the information retrieved from the website to the screen. The user is initially prompted to enter a city and a country. If either of those fields are missing, the user is met with an error message indicating that they have forgotten to enter a city and/or country. It displays the current temperature at the location in celsius, the forecasted maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as the actual weather at the location (rain, snow, etc.)
